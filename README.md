## Overview

JBXRC Desktop is a modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project serves as a foundation for creating fast, scalable desktop-like experiences in the browser. It leverages Vite's lightning-fast build tool for development and production, ensuring quick hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized bundles.

The core purpose of this repository is to provide a clean, minimal starting point for developers to build interactive web apps with type safety and performance in mind. Whether you're prototyping a new idea or building a full-fledged application, JBXRC Desktop offers a solid base to get started quickly.

## Features

- **React + TypeScript**: Build dynamic user interfaces with the reliability of static typing to catch errors early.
- **Vite-Powered Development**: Enjoy instant server startup, fast HMR, and efficient production builds.
- **ESLint Integration**: Maintain code quality with pre-configured linting rules for JavaScript, TypeScript, and React.
- **Plugin Support**: Includes `@vitejs/plugin-react` for Babel-based Fast Refresh, with an option to switch to `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` for even faster performance.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend with additional plugins, libraries, or configurations as your project grows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/uncleedev/jbxrc-desktop.git
   cd jbxrc-desktop
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or if you prefer yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. Launch the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

### Building for Production

To generate an optimized build for deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The output will be in the `dist` folder, ready for hosting.

### Running Lints

Check your code for issues:

```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Your main application code, including React components and TypeScript files.
- `public/`: Static assets like favicons or images.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for Vite.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript settings.
- `eslint.config.js`: Linting rules.
- `package.json`: Dependencies and scripts.

## Enhancing the Setup

For a more robust development experience in larger projects:

1. Enable type-aware ESLint rules by updating `eslint.config.js`:

   ```javascript
   export default {
     // ... existing config
     parserOptions: {
       ecmaVersion: "latest",
       sourceType: "module",
       project: ["./tsconfig.json", "./tsconfig.node.json"],
       tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
     },
   };
   ```

2. Switch to stricter rules like `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`.

3. Add React-specific rules by installing `eslint-plugin-react` and including `plugin:react/recommended` in the `extends` array.
